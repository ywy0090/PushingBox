# PushingBox
Multi-agent Pushing Box simulation in Matlab.
Based on single-agent Q learning algorithm in reinforcement learning.
Homogeneous agents box-pushing, the action set for each agent is {up down right left}.
It also includes team Q learning algorithm, however the team Q learning is quite slower.
